			<p>When I decided I wanted to do Medicine at university and began my application journey, I realised that
				there were so many aspects I didn't know - or even where to get information about them. I had no
				relatives or friends that had done this before. I found it very difficult to scour the internet for all
				the various pieces of information I needed; I ended up missing out on some opportunities as a result of
				not discovering them in time.</p>
			<p>That's why I want to help others avoid this scenario in the future.</p>
			<p>You can email me and we can arrange a video call and I'll try my best to answer all you questions and
				placate your concerns about the Medicine application process!</p>
