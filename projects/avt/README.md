AVT is a simple webapp I made to help collect data for the Ambient Voice Technology study.

There was already an old website which was quite good but was just missing a few quality of life features, so I quickly whipped up this version to replace it.


## Background

For the Ambient Voice Technology study we need to time how long certain activities take in the clinic, While we could just use a stopwatch, this web app makes it easier to time different activities simultaneously and keep track of multiple patients.
