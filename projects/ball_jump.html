			<p>This is where my journey into the world of programming began.</p>
			<p>The first programming language I learnt was Java, back when I was 12. A friend recommended it to me.
				After I had learnt the basic concepts, Ball Jump was my first project. It took me two months during my
				school summer holidays.</p>
			<p>Ball Jump is a 2D computer game that's a bit like <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger">Frogger</a>
				or <a href="https://www.crossyroad.com">Crossy Road</a> with powerups, coins, upgrades and achievements.
			</p>
			<p>I wanted to show my friends when we got back to school, so I put it up on a website called SourceForge
				for my friends to download. It somehow got 1000+ downloads worldwide (I suspect most of them were
				probably me doing some testing). Shortly after putting it up on SourceForge, I learnt some HTML, CSS and
				JavaScript and made my own website (before this one) and put Ball Jump up there.</p>
			<p>During secondary school, I worked on Ball Jump and made frequent updates for about a year. However, at
				present, it hasn't been maintained for years, so it likely won't work anymore - but there's a download
				link at the bottom of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!</p>

				<p>This button will download the installer file, which is an executable JAR file. The installer file
					will then download and unzip Ball Jump's files correctly for you.</p>
				<p>Since the installer file and Ball Jump only need the Java Virtual Machine to run, they should run on
					any desktop or laptop computer's operating system as long as you have JRE version 1.8 or higher
					installed. If you don't have it, you can download it for free from <a
						href="https://java.com/en/download/">https://java.com/en/download/</a>.</p>
				<p>After you've clicked the download button and the installer file has downloaded, double click on
					"Ball_Jump_Installer.jar" and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
