		<h1 class="pageTitle">Ball Jump</h1>
		<p>This is where my journey into the world of programming began.</p>
		<p>The first programming language I learnt was Java, back when I was 12. After I had learnt the basic concepts,
			Ball Jump was my first project. It took me 2 months during my school summer holidays.</p>
		<p>Ball Jump is a 2D computer game that's a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger">Frogger</a>
			or <a href="https://www.crossyroad.com">Crossy Road</a>.</p>
		<p>I wanted to show my friends when we got back to school so I put it up on a website called SourceForge for my
			friends to download. It somehow got over 1000 downloads across the world (I suspect most of them were
			probably me doing some testing). Shortly after putting it up on SourceForge, I learnt some HTML, CSS and
			JavaScript and made my own website (before this one) and put Ball Jump up there.</p>
		<p>During secondary school, I worked on Ball Jump and made frequent updates for about a year. However, at
			present, it hasn't been maintained for years so it likely won't work anymore but there's a download link at
			the bottom
			of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!</p>
