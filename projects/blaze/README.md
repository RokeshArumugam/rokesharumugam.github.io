Blaze is a project that I made to convert my university timetable from a website format to a subscribable calendar.

My university's timetable is only available on a website (after several logins and clicks) which they update frequently without notice so often students have turned up to a session only to find out that it was cancelled shortly before. This project lets me have an always-up-to-date calendar easily accessible on my phone.
