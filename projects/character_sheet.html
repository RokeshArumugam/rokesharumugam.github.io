				I play D&D with some friends at my college. In our first campaign I played a goliath barbarian which was
				the tank of our party. I had taken so much damage and changed my hit points so many times that the
				paper had permanent smudges was beginning to tear from excessive erasing. Consequently I started looking
				into digital character sheets. I had heard of some digital character sheets such as <a
					href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a> but they were paid and I didn't think I would ever
				use all of their features; so I created my own digital character sheet.
			</p>
			<p>
				This character sheet is heavily inspired by the <a
					href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf">D&D 5E character
					sheet</a> by the Wizards of the Coast. This character sheet automatically updates ability, saving
				throw and skill modifiers. It also automatically provides buttons that display information about your
				feats, spells, items, class, subclasses, background and race depending on what you type into the sheet.
				The information is scraped from <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com">http://dnd5e.wikidot.com</a>.

			<h2>Advantages Over Paper</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't have to look up what spells, feats, items, etc. do</li>
				<li>
					Don't have to manually update saving throw and skill check modifiers when your proficiency bonus or
					ability stats change
				</li>
				<li>
					Double checkboxes so you can mark down expertise in saving throws and skill checks in a neat way
				</li>
				<li>Can add as many spells and weapons as you want (more boxes get added automatically)</li>
				<li>Can enter and change as much detail as you want (text box scrolls)</li>
				<li>Can roll digitally (don't need to remember to bring your dice)</li>
				<li>Much harder to lose (it is autosaved on your device and you can also download an editable PDF)</li>
			</ul>
