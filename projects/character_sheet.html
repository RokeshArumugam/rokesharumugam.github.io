				I play D&D with some friends at my college. In our first campaign I played a goliath barbarian which was
				the tank of our party. I had taken so much damage and changed my hit points so many times that the
				paper had permanent smudges was beginning to tear from excessive erasing. Consequently I started looking
				into digital character sheets. I had heard of some digital character sheets such as <a
					href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a> but they were paid and I didn't think I would ever
				use all of their features. So I created my own digital character sheet.

				This character sheet is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf">D&D 5E character sheet</a> by the Wizards of the Coast. This character sheet automatically updates ability, saving throw and skill modifiers. It also automatically provides buttons that display information about your class, background, race, feats and subclasses depending on what you type into the sheet. The information is scraped from <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com">http://dnd5e.wikidot.com</a>.
