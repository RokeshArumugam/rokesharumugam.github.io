Command Bar is menu bar application for MacOS that allow you to run shell commands and see their outputs.

I spent a week creating this to save me (and hopefully other developers when I released Command Bar on the App Store) some time when performing routine tasks. However less than a week after I finished Command Bar I heard that Apple was developing almost identical functionality as part of their Shortcuts app on MacOS; so I abandoned this project.
