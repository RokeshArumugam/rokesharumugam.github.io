Easy Type is another secondary school project.

It is a text editor that I created for my classmates and me to use during ICT lessons at school.


## Background

I created Easy Type when I was in secondary school. They had just started teaching HTML and CSS programming; we had to use Notepad to view and edit our code - since you can't open two files in one Notepad window, we had to open two windows to see both our HTML and CSS code at once. So, during half term, I made Easy Type for my classmates and me to use during lessons.

Easy Type is a text editor that draws inspiration from Notepad and Notepad++.

Similar to my previous projects during my secondary school years, Easy Type hasn't been maintained for years, so it likely won't work anymore - but there's a download link at the bottom of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!

## Usage

[Download](https://rokesharumugam.com/FILES/easy_type/Easy_Type.zip)

This button will download the zip file. Unzip it and double click on "Easy_Type.jar".

Since Easy Type only needs the Java Virtual Machine to run, it should run on any desktop or laptop computer's operating system as long as you have JRE version 1.8 or higher installed. If you don't have it, you can download it for free from [https://java.com/en/download/](https://java.com/en/download/).
