				I created Easy Type when I was in secondary school. They had just started teaching HTML and CSS
				programming; we had to use Notepad to view and edit our code - since you can't open two files in one
				Notepad window, we had to open two windows to see both our HTML and CSS code at once. So, during half
				term, I made Easy Type for my classmates and me to use during lessons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Easy Type is a text editor that draws inspiration from Notepad and Notepad++.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar to my previous projects during my secondary school years, Easy Type hasn't been maintained for
				years, so it likely won't work anymore - but there's a download link at the bottom of the page and
				you're more than welcome to give it a try!

					Since Easy Type only needs the Java Virtual Machine to run, it should run on any desktop or laptop
					computer's operating system as long as you have JRE version 1.8 or higher installed. If you don't
					have it, you can download it for free from <a
