The Gonville & Caius May Ball website is a full-stack platform I built to support one of Cambridge's largest annual events. It manages event information, live updates, ticket sales, and interactive experiences for over 1,300 guests.

The site includes features such as live countdowns to key dates, real-time announcements, scavenger hunts with QR codes, a searchable FAQ, and an interactive SVG map that updates dynamically throughout the night. It integrates with TicketTailor and Stripe for ticket sales and is fully responsive, secure, and self-hosted.

This was my first end-to-end production deployment, covering development, system administration, and live operations. The project gave me experience in real-time systems, web security, and automation under tight deadlines, and it remains one of the most ambitious technical projects I've completed to date receiving excellent feedback from both guests and the committee for an event of such scale - £250k and 1,300 attendees.


## Background

Each year, Gonville & Caius College hosts a May Ball - a large-scale formal celebration attracting over a thousand attendees. The committee needed a website capable of handling live ticket sales, publishing real-time updates, and providing an engaging user experience. Previous events had relied on static pages or third-party tools that lacked flexibility.

When the committee couldn't find a developer, I volunteered and built the entire platform in roughly four weeks during the Christmas vacation. I had full control over a dedicated Linux server (funded by the college), allowing me to manage everything from the codebase to the hosting, deployment, and security.

The site went live in early 2024 and was used successfully during the event. I am currently maintaining and enhancing it for the 2026 May Ball.
