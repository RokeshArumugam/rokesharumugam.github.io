Meal Booking Website is a new website I created to (hopefully) replace the old meal booking website at my college (Gonville and Caius) at the University of Cambridge.

This was a nice project to do over the summer, but it is yet to be seen whether it will be bought by the college.


## Background

At my college (Gonville and Caius) we have to book meals in advance if we would like to dine at the college. The old meal booking website looks as if was made quite a while ago and I noticed that a lot of students (myself included) felt that it could be greatly improved. So I created an improved version over the long vacation that is more fitting of our esteemed college.

## Advantages Over Its Predecessor

- Cleaner UI and lots of quality of life improvements, including being more intuitive which is especially helpful to freshers
- Usual schedule of meals can be checked (such as which days have First and Formal Hall and which days have Cafeteria Hall) - this is especially useful for freshers
- Book meals by date instead of the type of meal
- Can still quickly access special meals without knowing their date
- History auto loads older bookings when you scroll down - like social media's infinite scrolling
- Meals have tags with important information like dress code, guests allowed, etc
- Allergen key can be checked - this is especially useful for freshers
- Currently booked in names can be filtered and friends can be specified to be at the top, since a lot of students find it annoying to scroll through the long list of names to check if their friends are booked in
- Currently booked in names can show first names instead of last names - this is especially useful for freshers since learning all those first names is hard enough
- It is mobile friendly with a hamburger menu at small screen sizes
- It is also designed to be relatively easy to integrate into the existing servers
- And finally, it supports dark mode
