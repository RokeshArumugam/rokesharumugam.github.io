				At my college (Gonville and Caius) we have to book meals in advance if we would like to dine at the
				college. The old meal booking website looks as if was made quite a while ago and I noticed that a lot of
				students (myself included) felt that it could be greatly improved. So I created an improved version over
				the long vacation that is more fitting of our esteemed college.

			<h2>Advantages Over the Old Website</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Cleaner UI and lots of quality of life improvements, including being more intuitive which is
					especially helpful to freshers
				</li>
				<li>
					Usual schedule of meals can be checked (such as which days have First and Formal Hall and which days
					have Cafeteria Hall) - this is especially useful for freshers
				</li>
				<li>Book meals by date instead of the type of meal</li>
				<li>Can still quickly access special meals without knowing their date</li>
				<li>History auto loads older bookings when you scroll down - like social media's infinite scrolling</li>
				<li>Meals have tags with important information like dress code, guests allowed, etc</li>
				<li>Allergen key can be checked - this is especially useful for freshers</li>
				<li>
					Currently booked in names can be filtered and friends can be specified to be at the top, since a lot
					of students find it annoying to scroll through the long list of names to check if their friends are
					booked in
				</li>
				<li>
					Currently booked in names can show first names instead of last names - this is especially useful for
					freshers since learning all those first names is hard enough
				</li>
				<li>It is mobile friendly with a hamburger menu at small screen sizes</li>
				<li>
					It is also designed to be relatively easy to integrate into the existing servers
				</li>
				<li>And finally, it supports dark mode</li>
