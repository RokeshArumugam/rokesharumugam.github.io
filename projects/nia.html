			<p>
				At my college (Gonville and Caius) undergraduate accommodation was allocated via choosing rooms on a
				website which consistently crashed every year of my undergraduate degree. For clinical medical students,
				we have to self-assign a representative who then manually allocates rooms to students based on their
				preferences. This involves a lot of back-and-forth communication and can be quite stressful as you are
				often blamed when students are unhappy with their rooms. I created NIA (Non-Irritating Allocator) to
				help with this.

				The following year, the situation somehow managed to worsen. There was no communication from the
				accommodation officer, and students were left with no idea whether they would have college-provided
				accommodation in a few weeks or not. I sent a link to NIA to the college in case it helps them.
