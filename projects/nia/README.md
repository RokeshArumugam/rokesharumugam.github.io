NIA is a simple webapp I made to help allocate accommodation to students at my college (Gonville and Caius) at the University of Cambridge.

For clinical medical students, we have to self-assign a representative who then manually allocates rooms to students based on their preferences. This can be a tedious task so I made NIA to help with this. Update (2025-08): the accommodation officer is MIA so I sent a link to NIA to the college in case it helps them.


## Background

At my college (Gonville and Caius) undergraduate accommodation was allocated via choosing rooms on a website which consistently crashed every year of my undergraduate degree. For clinical medical students, we have to self-assign a representative who then manually allocates rooms to students based on their preferences. This involves a lot of back-and-forth communication and can be quite stressful as you are often blamed when students are unhappy with their rooms. I created NIA (Non-Irritating Allocator) to help with this.

The following year, the situation somehow managed to worsen. There was no communication from the accommodation officer, and students were left with no idea whether they would have college-provided accommodation in a few weeks or not. I sent a link to NIA to the college in case it helps them.


## Description

- ⚡ Works in seconds to minutes, just upload your Excel file
- 🏠 Works even with a shortage of rooms for the number of students
- 🎯 Matches based on preference of budget, friends, parking, and location (even down to the floor!)
- 🏆 100% satisfaction is impossible, anything above 50% is a win
- 📝 Make sure your Excel file's sheet and column names match the template
- 📊 You can use a Google Form to gather data (you can look at the example form)
