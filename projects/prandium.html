				At my college (Gonville and Caius) we have to book meals in advance if we would like to dine at the
				college. The booking webpage may open as early as 6am and places may sell out in less than 5 seconds
				depending on the menu, number of courses and formality of the meal. This resulted in people setting
				alarms to wake up early to book meals and often still missing them due to being a few seconds slow. So I
				created Prandium to book meals for me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I let some friends use Prandium for free last year but now I have started allowing other people to use
				Prandium for a small fee.

			<h2>Prices</h2>
			<p>Currently, the maximum number of pre-bookings per meal is 6</p>
			<p>Pre-bookings for each term open 1 week before the start of full term</p>
			<p>There are S, A and B tier pre-bookings in order of increasing price</p>
			<p>Tiers are filled in order of increasing price (except S), so it's better to pre-book early</p>
			<p>
				Pre-bookings can be upgraded to a higher tier (B to A) if available but, don't worry, they will not be
				downgraded (A to B)
			</p>
			<p>
				Payment is due after each successful booking (this includes getting accepted from, but not to, the
				waiting list). If multiple meals have been pre-booked, total payment can be accepted at the end of term
				instead.
			</p>
			<p>Cancellations need to be requested with an 18-hour notice at minimum.</p>
