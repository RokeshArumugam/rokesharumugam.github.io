			At my college (Gonville and Caius) we have to book meals in advance if we would like to dine at the
			college. The old meal booking website looks as if was made quite a while ago and I noticed that a lot of
			students (myself included) felt that it could be greatly improved. So I created an improved version
			(which can be seen <a href="meal_booking_website.html">here</a>) over the long vacation that is more
			fitting of our esteemed college.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, it seems uncertain whether the college will actually use it, so in the meantime I converted it
			into Salt: a browser extension that everyone can benefit from immediately, for free!

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Salt drastically improves the UI, making information more readable, accessible and mobile-friendly.</p>
		<p>It also adds several quality-of-life features (many student-requested) such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A calendar to choose your meal</li>
			<li>Actual signup open dates instead of '4 days before'</li>
			<li>The ability to filter through who's booked in for a meal to find your friends</li>
			<li>In case that still takes too long, the ability to add your friends' names on the profile page so
				they always show at the top of the list</li>
			<li>Meals have tags (such as gowns, suits, black-tie, guests allowed, etc) so you don't have to read
				through all that text</li>
			<li>The allergen key can also be seen above the menu so you finally know what all those letters mean
			</li>
			<li>Dark mode so booking meals at 6am doesn't wake you up too much</li>
			<li>And much more!</li>
		</ul>
