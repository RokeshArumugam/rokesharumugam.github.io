Salt is a browser extension that enhances the meal booking website at my college (Gonville and Caius, University of Cambridge).

I originally built a full replacement for the meal booking system, but when the college decided not to adopt it, I created Salt so that students could still benefit immediately. It was rewarding to see dozens of people using it daily and to demonstrate that user-centred design and clever engineering can modernise even a legacy system from the outside.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with content scripts injected into existing web pages, Salt showcases front-end development, browser extension design, and UI/UX refinement. I also implemented automated configuration via remotely-hosted JSON and managed public deployment and updates through the Chrome Web Store. It was a great demonstration of how user-focused design and lightweight engineering can transform an outdated system with zero institutional involvement.


## Background

At Caius, students must book meals in advance through a dated and often cumbersome web portal. While developing a full replacement system (which can be seen [here](https://rokesharumugam.com/projects/?name=mealBookingWebsite)), I found that the collegeâ€™s administration decided not to adopt it, despite support from several staff members.

To let students still benefit from a better interface, I reworked the improvements into a browser extension. Salt 'adds flavour' and applies new functionality and visual improvements directly onto the existing website using injected scripts and styles. It proved immediately popular, reaching around 70 users at its peak before the old website was retired.

Salt was published to the Chrome Web Store and automatically updates for users, making it simple to install and use.


## Description

We all know Caius' current meal booking website leaves a lot to be desired.

Well, fear not!

No longer shall booking a meal be such a tasteless experience.

Salt drastically improves the UI, making information more readable, accessible and mobile-friendly.

It also adds several quality-of-life features (many student-requested) such as:

- A calendar to choose your meal
- One-click booking from the main page
- Actual signup open dates instead of '4 days before'
- The ability to filter through who's booked in for a meal to find your friends
- In case that still takes too long, the ability to add your friends' names on the profile page so they always show at the top of the list
- Meals have tags (such as gowns, suits, black-tie, guests allowed, etc) so you don't have to read through all that text
- The allergen key can also be seen above the menu so you finally know what all those letters mean
- You can quickly copy meal details to send to guests so they know the time, place, dress code, menu, etc
- Dark mode so booking meals at 6am doesn't wake you up too much
- And much more!

Note: if you're logged into a Google Account or Chrome Profile with your @cam.ac.uk email address, the
university doesn't let you use extensions. To use Salt you'll have to sign out of both your Google Account
and Chrome Profile to install it, then you can sign back into your Google Account.

Note: Salt was designed with students' experience in mind so it may be a little off for staff (they are very
welcome to give feedback so I can improve it for them!)
