Sesame is a project that allows my Raspberry Pi to unlock the front door of my accomodation using a servomotor and the intercom button in my room.

Instead of using my key to unlock the front door I can now just tap a button on my watch and buzz myself in or someone can send 'OPEN SESAME' to the WhatsApp groupchat. This was my first electronics projects so it was a good learning experience.
