				At my secondary school we were given iPads for studying. Initially we were able to download games on
				them but the school quickly caught on and restricted the App Store and popular gaming websites. However
				since my website wasn't even on Google back then, the school didn't know about it and hence it was still
				accessible; so I created this online version of Solitaire for my friends and me to play on our school
				iPads.
