Stickmen Battles is another project I made during my secondary school years.

It is a 2D computer game like Ball Jump - however, it was much more of a learning experience. It made me appreciate what worked for Ball Jump and not for Stickmen Battles.


## Background

After Ball Jump, I created Stickmen Battles in the following summer holidays. As I began working on Stickmen Battles, I discovered what a game engine was and realised that I had effectively created a 'game engine' while I developed Ball Jump - as I had written everything from scratch. I tried to use the same 'game engine' for Stickmen Battles. However, since I hadn't initially designed it to be reused in a different project, Stickmen Battles suffered as I worked within the constraints of my rudimentary 'game engine'. After this project, I came to know that I still had a lot to learn.

Stickmen Battles is a 2D computer game. You control a stickman and fight against randomly spawning enemy stickmen (PvE) of different types. You can jump up onto platforms to navigate the screen. Some powerups and coins drop during the game. You can use the coins to upgrade your character in the menu.

Similar to Ball Jump, Stickmen Battles hasn't been maintained for years, so it likely won't work anymore - but there's a download link at the bottom of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!
