				After Ball Jump, I created Stickmen Battles in the following summer holidays. As I began working on
				Stickmen Battles, I discovered what a game engine was and realised that I had effectively created a
				'game engine' while I developed Ball Jump - as I had written everything from scratch. I tried to use the
				same 'game engine' for Stickmen Battles. However, since I hadn't initially designed it to be reused in a
				different project, Stickmen Battles suffered as I worked within the constraints of my rudimentary 'game
				engine'. After this project, I came to know that I still had a lot to learn.

				Stickmen Battles is a 2D computer game. You control a stickman and fight against randomly spawning enemy
				stickmen (PvE) of different types. You can jump up onto platforms to navigate the screen. Some powerups
				and coins drop during the game. You can use the coins to upgrade your character in the menu.
			</p>

				Similar to Ball Jump, Stickmen Battles hasn't been maintained for years, so it likely won't work anymore
				- but there's a download link at the bottom of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!

					Since Stickmen Battles only needs the Java Virtual Machine to run, it should run on any desktop or
					laptop computer's operating system as long as you have JRE version 1.8 or higher installed. If you
					don't have it, you can download it for free from <a
