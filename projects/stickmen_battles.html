			<p>After Ball Jump, I created Stickmen Battles in my school summer holidays in the following year. As I
				began working on Stickmen Battles, I discovered what a game engine was and realised that I had
				effectively created a 'game engine' while I was developing Ball Jump - as I had written everything from
				scratch. I tried to use the same 'game engine' for Stickmen Battles. However since I hadn't originally
				designed it to be reused in a different project, Stickmen Battles suffered as I worked within the
				constraints of my rudimentary 'game engine'. After this project I came to know that I still had a lot to
				learn.</p>
			<p>Stickmen Battles is a 2D computer game. You control a stickman and fight against randomly spawning enemy
				stickmen (PvE) of different types. You can jump up onto platforms to navigate the screen. There are
				powerups and coins that drop during the game and your character can be upgraded in the menu.</p>
			<p>Similar to Ball Jump, Stickmen Battles hasn't been maintained for years so it likely won't work anymore
				but there's a download link at the bottom of the page and you're more than welcome to give it a try!</p>

			<section class="section--text">
				<p>This will download the installer file, which is an executable JAR file; the installer file will then
					download and unzip Stickmen Battles's files correctly for you.</p>
				<p>Since the installer file and Stickmen Battles only need the Java Virtual Machine to run, they should
					run on any desktop or laptop computer's operating system as long as you have JRE version 1.8 or
					higher installed. If you don't have it, you can download it for free from <a
						href="https://java.com/en/download/">https://java.com/en/download/</a></p>
				<p>After you've clicked the download button and the installer file has downloaded, double click on
					"Stickmen_Battles_Installer.jar" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
