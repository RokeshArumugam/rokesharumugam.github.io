				I was looking into making cross-platform mobile apps and came across something called PWAs (Progressive Web Apps). They are essentially websites that can be added to your device's homescreen like a bookmark, but, unlike normal websites, they will open and function similar to an app rather than a webpage in the browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had (and still have) a note on my phone about the TV shows I'm watching or have been recommended by my friends. I thought it would be much more efficient to have a dedicated app to track this, and hence, combined with my fascination with PWAs, this project was born.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project is nowhere near finished and was simply an experiment for me to see how PWAs work. PWAs seem like a way to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and make mobile apps for IOS and Android. I only spent a weekend on this but may come back to it in the future.
