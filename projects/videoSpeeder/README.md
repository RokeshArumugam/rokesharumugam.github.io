Video Speeder is a browser extension that allows you to change the playback speed of videos beyond the normal 0.5-2.0x.

I created this since I sometimes watch lectures at 3.0-4.0x speed, but I had to use Google Chrome instead of Safari (which is what I normally use) to use the 'Fast Panopto' extension - now I can stick with Safari.


## Background

For my university course we have nearly 200 lectures to watch in about 6 months - plus practicals, essays, and other work. To cope, I began speeding up lectures on Panopto which is the lecture-hosting platform that my university uses. However I soon reached the limit of 2x speed. To get around this I installed the 'Fast Panopto' extension to go up to 3.0-4.0x speed but this forced me to use Google Chrome instead of Safari since that where 'Fast Panopto' was available; so I created Video Speeder to use on Safari.
