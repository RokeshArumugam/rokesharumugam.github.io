Video Speeder is a browser extension that lets users watch videos faster than the standard 0.5–2.0x playback range. It provides full control over playback pace directly within the browser.

I built this tool to improve my studying efficiency during university, where watching lectures quickly was essential. Existing solutions like 'Fast Panopto' were Chrome-only, so I created my own version to work smoothly on Safari.

Developing Video Speeder gave me experience with browser extension APIs, DOM manipulation, and user interface design - all while solving a real-world problem that directly enhanced my productivity.


## Background

During my university course, I had to watch nearly 200 lectures over a six-month period while balancing essays, practicals, and other work. To save time, I began watching lectures at 2x speed using Panopto, the university’s lecture-hosting platform, but that was the maximum speed allowed.

To get around this, I used the 'Fast Panopto' Chrome extension to go up to 3.0-4.0x speed, but since I primarily use Safari, I decided to build my own. Video Speeder now lets me adjust playback speeds far beyond default limits without switching browsers.
